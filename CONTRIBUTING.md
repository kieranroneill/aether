## 1. Commit messages

Commit messages lean heavily towards the convention set out by [conventional commits][conventional-commits].

Each commit message must be in the format that includes a **type**, an optional **scope** and a **subject**:
```
type(scope?): subject  #scope is optional
```

Limit the whole message to 72 characters or less!

Example:

```
build(terraform): burn it all down
```

### 1.1. Type

Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: npm)
* **chore**: Changes that don't really fall under any other type
* **ci**: Changes to the CI configuration files and scripts
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **revert**: Revert a previous commit
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### 1.2. Scope

A scope may be provided to a commit’s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within a parenthesis

### 1.3. Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* don't capitalise the first letter
* don't use a fullstop (.) at the end. <- Not this

## 2. Pull requests

### 2.1 Branching strategy

This repo uses a [trunk-based][trunk-based] development workflow. There is one permanent branch, the `main` branch, which contains stable code and all releases are based off of any commits to this branch.

In order to make updates, a feature branch is made from the `main` branch and when it is ready to be merged, it can be brought back into the `main` branch which trigger a release (if necessary).

### 2.2 Merge to main

1. Create a branch from the `main` branch and use the convention: `<feat|fix|ci>/name-of-issue`.
2. Once the code is ready to be merged into `main`, open a pull request.
> ⚠️**NOTE:** The title must conform to the conventional commit message format outlined above. This is to ensure the merge commit to the main branch is picked up by the CI and creates a release (if necessary).
3. To merge the PR, use the "Squash and merge" option. This is to keep the commit history clean and keep the commits on `main` with a 1:1 ratio with previous PRs.
